Question 1
-Arithmetic operators;
(+),  the addition operator
(-),  the subtraction operator
(*),  the multiplication operator
(/),  the divison operator
(%),  the modulo operator
(**), the exponentiation operator
(++ --), the increment and decrement operators respectively.

-Assignment operators (=);
(+=), addition assignment operator
(-=), subtraction assignment operator
(*=), multiplication assignment operator
(/=), division assignment operator
(%=), modulo assignment operator

-Comparison Operators;
Relational operators
(>), greater than
(>=), greater or equal to
(<), less than
(<=), less than or equal to
Equality operators
(===), strict equality operator
(==), loose equality operator
(!==), not equal operator

-Logical operators;
(&&), logical AND operator
(||), logical OR operator
(!), NOT operator

-Bitwise operators;
(&), And
(|), OR
(^), XOR
(~), NOT
(<<), Zero fill left shift
(>>), signed right shift
(>>>), zero fill right shift

QUESTION 2
-Arithmetic operator,
 let a = 2;
 let b = 3;

 let sum = (a+b);
 console.log(sum);

 let division = (b/a);
 console.log(division);
 
 -Assignment operators;

a = a+3;
console.log(a);

b *=6;
console.log(b);

-Comparison operators;

let x = 2;
console.log(x > sum);

let y = '2';
console.log(y === x);

-Logical operators;
